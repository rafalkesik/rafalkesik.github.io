**Here is how to become:**
1. Better than genAI;
2. Better than junior competition

**Goal 1: Become better than genAI.**

Noone wants to become replaced by genAI. As of today, It can produce low-quality code with substantial churn. If what some suspect is correct [LINK], and our AI models are running ouf of quality data and will stop achieving such big improvements... there will still be place for junior software developers.


In order to be better, I need to have solid background and understanding of what I'm doing. Quick bootcamp or easy course online won't do it. 
A good start is to have a good roadmap of where I'm going. That's why I'm using https://roadmap.sh/ as a guide.

I have also began a series of solid courses by Michael Hartl: "Learn Enough Software Development to Be Dangerous". It covers deep understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails and other technologies.

These courses teach you a lot from scratch, make you try out different approaches to understand their limitations. It stresses out the imporatnce of clean code, appriopriate naming-conventions, usage of classes etc.

Additionally, Michael Hartl puts a big emphasis on a skill called "Technical Sophistication". It's the ability to find solutions to new problems, understand new code, but also playing with your code (by cancelling lines etc) to see how it affects the outcome.

**Goal 2: Become better than junior competition.**

By learning the basics of clean, error-resistant code, one can jump ahead of the junior competition. 

Another way is to know a bit more than them and show it in one's portfolio. I have decided to learn fundamentals of front-end development, and then switch to Ruby on Rails. Then I will create projects utillizing both skills to showcase the ability to create full web applications and the general knowledge in the field of software development.

Other skills that could make you stand out are also important. Do you know anything about SDLC, Agile approach, Security, project management? Can you work on your soft skills that would make you more communicative and trustworthy employee? Could you work directly with a client and be the support of Account Executives? 
All of these play a role in you getting that job and being worth much more than a mere coder.
I have gained these skills in my previous workplaces and could leverage that during job interviews.

That's the plan. Now off we go to the tech side of things!
